# https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/


# Python3 implementation of the approach

# Function that returns true if it is possible
# to rearrange the characters of the String
# such that no two consecutive characters are same
def isPossible(Str):
    # To store the frequency of
    # each of the character
    freq = dict()

    # To store the maximum frequency so far
    max_freq = 0
    for j in range(len(Str)):
        freq[Str[j]] = freq.get(Str[j], 0) + 1
        if (freq[Str[j]] > max_freq):
            max_freq = freq[Str[j]]

        # If possible
    if (max_freq <= (len(Str) - max_freq + 1)):
        return True
    return False


# Driver code
Str = "abab"

if (isPossible(Str)):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
